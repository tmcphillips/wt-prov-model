# Example Tale: Mapping Estimated Water Usage


This notebook is intended to demonstrate how Whole Tale can be used to create interactive visualizations of data published via DataONE. This assumes that the file `usco2005.xls`  has been added from the following dataset: 

> Daniel White and Lilian Alessa. Humans and Hydrology at High Latitudes: Water Use Information. Arctic Data Center. [doi:10.5065/D6862DM8](doi:10.5065/D6862DM8).

## Notes:
1. The notebook reads the excel document in `./inputs/` and writes the html file in `./outputs/`
1. This is an example where Reprozip misses an input
